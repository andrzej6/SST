#Facebook Conversion Tracking Plus

###Version 1.0

##Short Description

The Ultimate Facebook Conversion Tracking Module. A multi-pixel module that can track checkouts, registrations, add to cart actions, and keypages. All-in-one

##Benefits

A module designed to optimize Facebook Ads and increase ROI. The FCTP it's an evolution of our Facebook Conversion Tracking Module. With the multi-pixel option you will be able to create as many pixels as you need. We recommend to not create more than one registration or checkout pixels as the triggers for the code are always the same.

With this module you can track:
 • Checkouts
 • New users Registrations
 • Add to Carts
 • Keypages (+5 with more than 5 types of keypages)

With Keypages tracking you can track any Prestashop page with an automatic multi-language detection ready*.

It's an all-in-one perfect for advanced users and agencies or new business who aims to do their online marketing with Facebook.

The multi-language function will not work with search Keypages as they are inputted manually, so if you want to track a multi-language search you just need to create a pixel for each language to track.
