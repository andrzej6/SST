They also facilitate the hips to slant slightly forward,    moving your back to positive alignment and thereby reduced risk of slouching.    <br/><br/>    What’s more, these ergonomic desk chairs increase productivity too. Improved concentration and less physical    strain will help you develop a more positive attitude to help you get the work done.</div><div class="benefits-title">Things to consider BEFORE BUYING </div><div class="benefits-container">  <ul class="benefits-ul2 benefits-block">     <li><div class="benefits-li">Is it height-adjustable? If yes, you may also use the solution as a standing aid to perch on.</div></li>     <li><div class="benefits-li">             How easily does it encourage movement?  Remember “your next position is your best position” so any             office seat or stool should ideally encourage you to move more up/down or from side to side.         </div></li>     <li><div class="benefits-li">             Will it improve my posture? Ideally any Active Seating solution will encourage you to move your             hips forward, and bring positive alignment to your spine. It should strengthen your abs as well             as other muscles, thus reducing back strain and stress building up in your shoulders.</div></li>     <li><div class="benefits-li">Lightweight solutions have the benefit of quick and easy lifting. This will             encourage you to switch more frequently between standing and sitting. These micro-movements are             hugely important.</div></li>     <li><div class="benefits-li">Be prepared to bounce, wobble, and tilt in order to avoid hazardous inactive or static sitting.</div></li></ul>  </div><div class="benefits-title">Things to consider when GETTING STARTED</div><div class="benefits-container">  <ul class="benefits-ul2 benefits-block">     <li><div class="benefits-li">Getting used to an active seat or stool may take some practice, especially at first.             Get up and down frequently to maximise the benefits and avoid poor posture.</div></li>     <li><div class="benefits-li">As soon as you get tired or start losing your intended posture by slouching,             it is recommended to switch to standing. Only if absolutely necessary should you invest in a chair             with more support.</div></li>      <li><div class="benefits-li">By gradually increasing your active sitting time you will build-up              stronger muscles and more core strength resulting in a better overall posture and health.</div></li></ul> </div>
