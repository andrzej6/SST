Standing at work is important for health, but it’s vital that we do it safely and comfortably to reduce the risk of associated musculoskeletal strains and injuries.<br/><br/>Standing in one position on hard surfaces puts extra pressure on the walls of veins making the heart work harder and causing feet to swell; conditions that can lead to pain and physical fatigue/injury  The cushioning of a mat encourages regular foot movement (even when you stand in static position) as the feet subtly adapt to the mat’s surface, which helps circulation. Subtle movement forces the foot and calf muscles to expand and contract, which activates the venous pump, circulating the blood. An <strong>anti-fatigue mat</strong> effectively helps to reduce pressure, risk of pain and boosting blood circulation in your legs.<br/><br/><div class="benefits-title">FREE MAT OFFER</div>		<span class="yy-blue" style="font-size:15px">	   To take advantage of these great offers, you must add the correct 	   mat to your basket.
